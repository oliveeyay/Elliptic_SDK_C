You can find some examples of use for this library in the file main.cpp :
- a Diffie Hellman test (key exchange process using the Diffie Hellman algorithm)
- a El Gamal test (encryption/decryption using the El Gamal algorithm)
- a ECDSA signature test (sign and verify signature using the ECDSA algorithm)



Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any question on this software.
